Such matters are not within the mandate of the Secretary-General's representative. Experts, officials and observers are unanimous that weapons are being smuggled into Syrian territory from bordering States, including Lebanon. The competent authorities in Syria have repeatedly announced confiscations of weapons, explosives and explosive devices smuggled from Lebanon to Syria by certain Lebanese political forces linked to terrorist groups funded and armed from abroad.
